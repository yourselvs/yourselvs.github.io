      <h3>
        Predicting League of Legends
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        For the final project of my Introduction to Data Science, we had to analyze a data set. 
        I love League of Legends, and I chose to focus my project around the game. 
        I tried to predict the winner of a game using 180,000 matches using linear regression in R. 
        You can find the final project <a href="https://yourselvs.me/final">here</a>.

      <h3>
        Krane Multigames
      </h3>

      <p>
        <a id="steam-mg-map" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=483298969">Krane multigames</a> is a 
        CS:GO multigames map featuring 17 minigames, 8 of which are completely original. 
        Each round, players have to jump around the center platforms to find the correct one. 
        The winner gets to choose the minigame of the round. Minigames range from team battles to courses with a single winner. 
        I don't update it as much as I used to, but it's one of my favorite projects.

      <h3>
          Co-op Retribution
      </h3>

      <p>
        Co-op Retribution (working title) is a single-player experience built in CS:GO where I worked as the programmer in a 3-person team. 
        CS:GO is a multiplayer game, and has limited functionality we could use for single-player mechanics. 
        I set up an event-based system behind all of the events in the map, controlling player movement throughout the map and orchestrating setpieces. 
        I created a spawning framework that allowed spawning new enemies to be very simple yet very customizable. 
        I also created makeshift AI for a companion to provide fire support. 
        The project isn't completed yet so it isn't public. Scripts were done in <a href="http://www.squirrel-lang.org/">Squirrel</a>.

      <h3>
        Minecraft
      </h3>

      <p>
        My Minecraft multiplayer plugins use <a href="https://bukkit.org/">Bukkit</a>/<a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/">Spigot</a>. 
        My biggest and most recent project is the <a id="dungeons-link" href="https://github.com/yourselvs/Dungeons">Dungeons plugin</a>. 
        The plugin allows servers to create timed courses for players to travel through. 
        Players are able to compete and compare their fastest times. 
        Data is handled in MongoDB, and the plugin is interfaced with using the command line. 
        I've also released the <a id="suggestion-link" href="https://github.com/yourselvs/SuggestionHelper">SuggestionHelper plugin</a>, 
        allowing players to send suggestion tickets to the server, and a prototype 
        for the <a id="simplepoll-link" href="https://github.com/yourselvs/SimplePoll">SimplePoll plugin</a>, which lets a server create polls.
