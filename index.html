<p>Hello! My name is Michael Makogon (yourselvs, misspelt on purpose) and I am a computer science student at the University of Maryland. This site is a hub of some of my personal projects and information. If you have any questions about me or the information on this site, contact me at <a id="yourselvs-email" href="mailto:michael.makogon@gmail.com">michael.makogon@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<a id="leaguedata" class="anchor" href="#league" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Predicting League of Legends</h3>
      
<p>For the final project of my Introduction to Data Science, we had to analyze a data set. I love League of Legends, and I chose to focus my project around the game. I tried to predict the winner of a game using 180,000 matches using linear regression in RStudio. You can find the final project <a href="https://yourselvs.github.io/final">here</a>.</p>

<a id="krane" class="anchor" href="#krane_multigames" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Krane Multigames</h3>

<p><a id="steam-mg-map" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=483298969">Krane multigames</a> is a CS:GO multigames map featuring 17 minigames, 8 of which are completely original. Each round, players have to jump around the center platforms to find the correct one. The winner gets to choose the minigame of the round. Minigames range from team battles to courses with a single winner. I don't update it as much as I used to, but it's one of my favorite projects. <a id="steam-profile" href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourselvs">my profile</a>.</p>

<a id="coop" class="anchor" href="#coop_retribution" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Coop Retribution</h3>

<p>
Coop Retribution (working title) is a single-player experience built in CS:GO where I worked as the programmer in a 3-person team. CS:GO is a multiplayer game, and has limited functionality we could use for single-player mechanics. I set up an event-based system behind all of the events in the map, controlling player movement throughout the map and orchestrating setpieces. I created a spawning framework that allowed spawning new enemies to be very simple yet very customizable. I also created makeshift AI for a companion to provide fire support. The project isn't completed yet so it isn't public. Scripts were done in <a href="http://www.squirrel-lang.org/">Squirrel</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="minecraft" class="anchor" href="#minecraft" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Minecraft</h3>

<p>My Minecraft multiplayer plugins use <a href="https://bukkit.org/">Bukkit</a>/<a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/">Spigot</a>. My biggest and most recent project is the <a id="dungeons-link" href="https://github.com/yourselvs/Dungeons">Dungeons plugin</a>. The plugin allows servers to create timed courses for players to travel through. Players are able to compete and compare their fastest times. Data is handled in MongoDB, and the plugin is interfaced with using the command line. I've also released the <a id="suggestion-link" href="https://github.com/yourselvs/SuggestionHelper">SuggestionHelper plugin</a>, allowing players to send suggestion tickets to the server, and a prototype for the <a id="simplepoll-link" href="https://github.com/yourselvs/SimplePoll">SimplePoll plugin</a>, which lets a server create polls.</p>

<a id="hazecraft" class="anchor" href="#hazecraft" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>HazeCraft</h3>

<p>Currently, I am an administrator on the Minecraft survival server <a id="hazecraft-link" href="hazecaft.net">HazeCraft</a>. Recently, the server has been acquired by the team at <a id="hostvenom-link" href="http://www.hostvenom.com/">HostVenomLLC</a> and <a id="ready2frag-link" href="https://ready2frag.com/">Ready2Frag</a> (which are both excellent server hosting companies that I wholeheartedly recommend, not just for Minecraft). Since the acquisition, we've been rebuilding the server into a revamped Minecraft network. I've been with the server for almost 5 years now, and it has an incredible community and staff team. I highly recommend you check it out!</p>
