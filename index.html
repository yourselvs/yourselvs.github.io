<a id="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my website.</h3>

<p>Hello! My name is Michael Makogon (known online as 'yourselvs', misspelt on purpose) and I am a computer science student at the University of Maryland. This site is a hub of all the information I've compiled about myself. I've created this partially for myself, but mostly for others. Feel free to add me on any social media I'm active on (fair warning: I'm not active on a lot of sites). If you have any questions about me or the information on this site, contact me at <a id="yourselvs-email" href="mailto:info@yourselvs.me">info@yourselvs.me</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="steam" class="anchor" href="#steam" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Steam</h3>

<p>One "social media" site I'm quite active on is Steam. If you want to chat or play games, add me from <a id="steam-profile" href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourselvs">my profile</a>. I have published a <a id="steam-mg-map" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=483298969">CS:GO minigames map</a> that I'm quite proud of. I don't update it as much as I used to, but it's one of my favorite projects.In the future I hope to create more CS:GO maps such as a de_ map based off of the de_krane minigame, or another minigame map based off the AWP ghosts minigame. If you have any suggestions, or questions about making a map, add me and I would love to talk with you!</p>

<h3>
<a id="github" class="anchor" href="#github" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GitHub</h3>

<p>Another "social media" site I often use is GitHub. All of my projects, personal- or school-related, are hosted there (including this website). Check out my projects on <a id="github-link" href="https://github.com/yourselvs">my GitHub page</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="minecraft" class="anchor" href="#minecraft" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Minecraft</h3>

<p>Currently, most of my active projects are Minecraft multiplayer plugins written for Bukkit/Spigot. My biggest and most recent project is the <a id="dungeons-link" href="https://github.com/yourselvs/Dungeons">Dungeons plugin</a>. I've also released the <a id="suggestion-link" href="https://github.com/yourselvs/SuggestionHelper">SuggestionHelper plugin</a> and a prototype for the <a id="simplepoll-link" href="https://github.com/yourselvs/SimplePoll">SimplePoll plugin</a>. Through developing these plugins, I've also been active on <a id="bukkit-link" href="https://bukkit.org/members/yourselvs.91049371/">my Bukkit page</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="hazecraft" class="anchor" href="#hazecraft" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>HazeCraft</h3>

<p>Currently, I am an administrator on the Minecraft survival server <a id="hazecraft-link" href="hazecaft.net">HazeCraft</a>. Recently, the server has been acquired by the team at <a id="hostvenom-link" href="http://www.hostvenom.com/">HostVenomLLC</a> and <a id="ready2frag-link" href="https://ready2frag.com/">Ready2Frag</a> (which are both excellent server hosting companies that I wholeheartedly recommend, not just for Minecraft). Since the acquisition, we've been rebuilding the server into a revamped Minecraft network. I've been with the server for almost 5 years now, and it has an incredible community and staff team. I highly recommend you check it out!</p>
